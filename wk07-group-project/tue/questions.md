## All the Little Things

First, read Chapters 1-3 of the [Rails Testing Guide][rtg] to
jog your memory on some of the mechanics of writing and running
tests.

Then, watch Sandi Metz' RailsConf 2014 talk ["All the Little Things"][alt].

Post questions about the talk and testing practices as comments
in your github issue.
