This could be us but you playin ...

# Preliminaries

Thoughts:

--

* "Possibly the only real object-oriented system in working order." - Alan Kay speaking about the Internet

--

* "Hell is other people's code." - Sartre paraphrased

--

* Ruby has a very, very flexible syntax. All the more important that we know what the boundaries are. Let's talk about this in review.

---

# Big Picture Goals for this Week

--

* Understand the universal language of HTTP (and a loose notion of RESTful)

--

* Gain comfort reading API docs and working with JSON responses

--

* Understand the distinction between URL encoding (queryparams) and postdata (form data)

--

* Solidify our understanding of Ruby evaluation, definitions, objects, and scope

--

* Begin to explore branches and pull requests for collaborating on projects

---

### Minutiae/Bonus

--

* Appreciate the various methods of authentication (Basic Auth, tokens, OAuth, etc.)

--

* Little ruby things: Maybe learn about Blocks, Exception Handling, Mixins, or Class Methods

---

# Progress Reports

* Finished week 1 & 2 progress reports and sent out last night.

--

* Don't panic!

--

* Feel free to email me or grab me if you have questions!

--

* I'd love to do code review or expand on the progress report in 1-on-1 meetings. Calendly reminder! :)

---

# Homework Notes

You should be committing any time you finish a method or stop to take a break.

Go ahead and push to github! Hiding code doesn't do any good. :)

## And Now For Something Completely Different

Let's Talk About The Web

![internets](http://img.pandawhale.com/55888-Abed-quote-EHNc.gif)

---

## Where are them servers?

* DNS / Name Resolution

redlinernotes.com isn't a "real" place

74.207.227.162 is the server's IP address

--

* IP Addresses

An IPv4 address is any group of four "octets"

0.0.0.0 up to 255.255.255.255

--

* What do I need to know?

DNS exists to map Domain Names to IP addresses.

We usually substitute domain names with all our
tools since they're easier to remember but IP
works just fine.

---

## How do we interact with them?

* Talk to them with a web browser, or better,
  an HTTP client
  * curl (command line tool, installed by default on mac/linux)
  * [httparty][httparty] (ruby library)

[httparty]: http://johnnunemaker.com/httparty/

--

What does the word "server" mean to you?

--

Alan Kay said the internet is the only truly object oriented system
(though he also says some derogatory things about "the web"). We'll
see how in point of fact, the web is really just a series of **requests**
and **responses** made over HTTP.

---

## HTT What now?

* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Very simple idea:

* Client makes a **request**, Server sends a **response**

* Response has two essential pieces: status code and body.

* HTTP "Methods" ( different kinds of requests )
  * GET - Retrieve existing thing(s)
  * POST - Create a new thing
  * PUT - Update an existing thing
  * DELETE - Remove an existing thing

---

## So about those responses...

* Important HTTP [Response Codes][http_codes] (aka Status Codes)
  * 200 - OK / 201 - Created
  * 401 - Unauthorized
  * 404 - Page Not Found

* The broad response code categories
  * 2xx - Success
  * 3xx - Redirect
  * 4xx - Client made a mistake
  * 5xx - Server made a mistake

[http_codes]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

---

## What can we do?

Well, that sort of depends on what API we want
to use.

API - Application Programming Interface

--

Really just that last word is important.
It's an interface. You've been reading API
docs this whole time for ActiveRecord and
Ruby. An API is just a contract that says,
"if you do this, i'll do that".

--

Any serious web service offers some sort of
public API. We'll look at Github's in a minute.

Two quick things before we do. You're going to
hear the words REST and JSON a **lot** so...

---

## What the hell are REST and JSON?

### JSON - Javascript Object Notation

Just a serialization format.

Like YAML, XML, others.

#### Got some text in JSON?

`require 'json'`

`JSON.parse my_text`

You get a hash table back.
Not much more to it really.

---

## What the hell are REST and JSON?

### REST - Representational State Transfer

Much like "Object Oriented", there is no precise and widely
accepted definition which leads to a lot of feels on the net.

For now, don't worry too much about REST.
We'll talk about it more a little later in the course.

---

## Aside: Exception Handling

Things can go wrong here, right?
* Suddenly dealing with 'distributed systems'
* What if the network goes down?
* What if the server decides we're bothering it too much?

--

We need to handle it gracefully! When things go wrong,
an exception is thrown.

---

## Exception Handling in Ruby

Often known as `try / catch` or similar in other languages.

Done with `begin / rescue / end`. A few rules:

* __Always__ name a specific exception class you're
  trying to rescue from. Otherwise *any* old error
  will be swallowed up. If you let it "bubble up",
  some other part of your program may know how to
  handle it. For example, RecordNotFound in Rails.
* You *may* bind the exception to a variable for
  inspection / logging / etc.
* You may use multiple rescue blocks to catch
  catch different kinds of exceptions.
  I.e. I probably want to handle network outages
  and 404 pages differently.
* Rescue blocks generally come at the end of a
  method.

I'll write a quick example where I recover from an
UndefinedLocalError or trying to divide by zero.

## Finale: Let's build a github scraper!
