* Defining Forms (module, class, def)
  * Variable definition (arguments, locals, instance vars, constants)
* Names (modules/classes, locals, instance vars, constants)

* Aha! The real question.
* Even experienced programmers struggle with this one.
* This is why there are no perfect programs.

* It's easy to make mistake of thinking programming is about *tools*. It is not.
* Programming is about making tradeoffs, trying to choose the right tool is one of them.
* We have an *abundance* of tools and techniques for solving problems.
  Picking the right on at the right time is non-trivial.
